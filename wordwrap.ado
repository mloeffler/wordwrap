/**
 * WORDWRAP - WRAPS A STRING TO A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF CHARACTERS
 * 
 * Reads long strings and wraps them to a specific line length. It returns
 * a properly wrapped multi-line version of the same string. No hyphenation.
 *
 * This ado-file is very similar to the code by Scott Merryman and Raymond P.
 * Guiteras posted on the Stata list. All credit goes to them for pointing out
 * this simple way of breaking long lines even years ago:
 *  - http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2007-03/msg00778.html
 *  - http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2008-01/msg00579.html
 *
 * 2014-11-25   Initial version (v0.1)
 * 2015-01-02   Bugfix (return text if length < maxlength)
